# Traffic-severity-ML
This project focuses on building a predictive model to determine the severity of traffic accidents in the United States based on various factors such as weather conditions, location, time, and road features.

Leveraging the US Accidents dataset from Kaggle, the goal is to assist traffic management systems and emergency services by proactively assessing risk and responding more effectively.
